            I am an Edinburgh-based software developer with several years' of experience in the modern cloud landscape.
            I have experience with modern web and mobile applications involving server-side and client-side development;
            cloud-based integrations including Amazon Web Services, Google, Salesforce.com and Heroku.
            I hold certifications for Amazon Web Services and Force.com and have a
            very strong mathematical and analytical background. Please check out my
